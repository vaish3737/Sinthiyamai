	<p> I am Vaishali and I am from Chennai,India.I am a student in US and this was the first ever time away from my home in 23 years,I felt real lonely and depressed.A lot of pain arised and I was trying to oppress it finally it all got together and came up as a correlation of words appending letters.I initially posted it in my social media accounts and I got a lot of positive response people never believed that I came up with it myself.</p>

	<p> That is how <i>Sinthiyamai</i> was initially formed.The word is coined from the world's first language "Tamil".My <i>Sinthiyami</i> is kind of double entendre,it as two meanings."Mai" refers to ink and "Sinthiya" refers to spilled so together it means Spilled ink.The second meaning of Sinthiyamai can be perceived from the same word which when syllabified by other means "Sinthi" and "Amai" means "to think" and "silence" thinking in silence.So consolidated I would like to put my tagline as "Thoughts spilled in silence!"</p>
